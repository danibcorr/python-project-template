# Python Project Template

Welcome to the **Python Project Template** repository! This template is designed to help you quickly set up a Python project with essential tools and best practices for **code quality, security, complexity analysis, testing, and deployment**. Whether you’re starting a new project or looking to standardize your development workflow, this template provides a solid foundation.

For more details about the tools and configurations used in this project, see the [Content](./content/content.md) page.

## Features

- **Code Quality Tools**: Integrated with [Black](https://github.com/psf/black) for automatic code formatting, [Flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/) for linting, and [Mypy](http://mypy-lang.org/) for static type checking.
- **Security Analysis**: Uses [Bandit](https://bandit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to identify common security issues in your Python code.
- **Code Complexity Analysis**: Integrated with [Complexipy](https://rohaquinlop.github.io/complexipy/) to measure and analyze the complexity of the codebase.
- **Testing**: Built-in support for [Pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/) for running tests and ensuring code correctness.
- **Documentation**: Uses [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) for generating beautiful documentation websites, with the [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) theme.
- **Deployment**: Easily deploys documentation to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

## Installation and Setup

Setting up your development environment with this project template is quick and easy. Just follow these steps:

### **1. Clone the Repository**

First, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/python-project-template.git
cd python-project-template
```

### **2. Activate Your Python Environment**  

Next, activate your Python virtual environment. This will depend on your operating system and the environment created.

### **3. Install Dependencies and Set Up the Project**  

This template includes a `Makefile` that automates the setup process, including installing dependencies and preparing the environment. To run the setup, simply execute:

```bash
make
```

This will automatically install all the required dependencies and set up the environment for linting, testing, security analysis, and documentation.
