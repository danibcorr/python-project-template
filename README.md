# Python Project Template

Welcome to the **Python Project Template** repository! This template is designed to help you quickly set up a Python project with essential tools and best practices for code quality, testing, and deployment. Whether youâ€™re starting a new project or looking to standardize your development workflow, this template provides a solid foundation.

For more details about the tools and configurations used in this project, see the [Content](./content/content.md) page.

## Features

- **Code Quality Tools**: Integrated with [Black](https://github.com/psf/black) for automatic code formatting, [Flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/) for linting, and [Mypy](http://mypy-lang.org/) for static type checking.
- **Testing**: Built-in support for [Pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/) for testing your Python code.
- **Documentation**: Uses [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) for generating beautiful documentation websites, with the [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) theme.
- **Deployment**: Easily deploys documentation to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
